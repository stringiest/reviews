## PROCESS REVIEWS

 At Makers, reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They are conducted by [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/)

This repository is a record of my reviews during my time at Makers.

 ### What happens during a Review at Makers?
 The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

- Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
- Writes good tests,
- Writes clean code,
- Debugs when things go wrong,
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

The review offers developers formative feedback: feedback to help Makers do better, and prepare them for job interviews and developer roles. Itâ€™s not summative - there is no pass/fail measurement involved.

## GENERAL FEEDBACK

### 2
**05 February 2021 / 02:00 PM / Reviewer: Ronald Munodawafa** "Your programming has improved quite considerably from the last reviews. I appreciate the resourcefulness you employ in your process. I encourage you to spend more time reading backtrace messages, your testing discipline and including refactor phases. Focussing on these will refine your brilliant process further."

**17 December 2020 / 09:00 AM / Reviewer: Ronald Munodawafa** "You currently have a good basis for forming a solid development methodology. You have a sense of test-first development. The process could be refined further by being more iterative and incremental. Taking more time to analyse the requirements the client has given you would also help inform the development process better. That said, I was happy to see the direct use of the example the client provided. It showed explicit focus on the client's needs. Well done!"
