Would like to help teachers analyse test results

Build a test results reporter, they will give us a series of test results and as output they will expect categorisation in a report.

Input will only be test results, output for each teacher, one at a time.

Grades are green, amber and red.  The output should count the number of each grade.

E.g. of input: is a string "Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green"
output=> "Green: 3\nAmber: 1\nRed: 1"

## Working notes

Input string, output string

method needs to count each type of grade.

Convert into an array, then count through the array.

Count method should return the number of each type of item.
